# infinity-cave

Infinity Cave adds a seemingly infinite cave system beneath the bedrock layer increasing the bedrock layer from -64 to -128. With this comes many new challenges and an overall different way of experiencing PvE.

This is a custom "Fork" (not an actual fork because they don't have their own code in their repo yet) of [Frozeh's Infinity Cave](https://github.com/Frozeh/infinity-cave) which is GNU LGPL as seen [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infinity-cave#license)
